  <div class="wrapper">
    <p>Hello! My name is Gino Valente. I am a Product Designer from Seattle.</p>
    <p>I employ a strong product sense to achieve business goals while crafting experiences that empower users through effective information design. I thrive in highly collaborative environments, contributing end-to-end on big picture strategic decisions while shepherding an evolving product vision through its detailed-focused design and technical implementation phases. Tackling whatever brought the product the most value at the time, my career has spanned UX / UI / Visual design across web, mobile and desktop platforms as well as desktop UI engineering.</p>

  <div class="wrapper">
    <p>Outside of work I love to push my physical practices with a calisthenics approach that incorporates yoga, circus-based inversion training, and other movement explorations. I also volunteer at many local Seattle theatres and enjoy experiencing lots of theatre, live music, and cinema.</p>
