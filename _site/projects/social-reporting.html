  <p>I joined Simply Measured in 2012 as the 19th employee because the team was doing impossible things within the constrained platform of Microsoft Excel and paving the way for the new industry of Social Measurement. Our passion was making social media data accessible to all organizational levels and empower digital marketers to do their best work simply.</p>
  <div class="spacer"></div>
  <h2 class="content-header">My Roles</h2>
  <p>I held a wide range of responsibilities as one of two Product Designers of our reporting product and was involved in technical projects with our engineering teams to deliver new functionality to our users.</p>
  <span><strong>UI & UX Designer</strong></span>
  <p>I was the sole Report UI designer who created the visual layers of the entire portfolio of over 50 reports. I worked with our Product Marketing and Analyst teams to craft the stories of each report from ideation and implemented the visual layer entirely in Excel using [way too many] AutoShapes. My mission was to delight the user with beautiful visualizations and make them think “wow, this can’t be Excel.”</p>
  <span><strong>Technical Product Designer</strong></span>
  <p>I worked on an array of engineering projects to bring new functionality to our reporting platform and created numerous automation solutions through custom Excel plugins using C# and VBA.</p>

    <h2 class="content-header">The Problem</h2>
    <p>Designing a delightful product experience within a familiar but stigmatic platform was an exciting problem solving opportunity.</p>
    <span><strong>Educating an Industry</strong></span>
    <p>Without a reliable ROI KPI to hook into, major brands had no idea how to measure their social campaigns. It was up to us to educate the industry by transforming data into actionable and insightful information.</p>
    <span><strong>The Nuances of Social Data</strong></span>
    <p>Telling a concise and actionable story about a brand’s social activity across different social networks is a balancing act of available data and creating industry standards. Our rapid go-to-market pace meant we were often designing reports before a network’s own API and story was complete.</p>
    <span><strong>Effective Information Design</strong></span>
    <p>Effective Information Design simplifies the essence of data into a story that provides insights and enables exploration and discovery. We were pioneering the form to answers of the many social measurement use cases and business objectives through static reports delivered as Excel files rendering on the web.</p>
    <span><strong>Reinventing a Platform</strong></span>
    <p>Limitations in design capabilities, systemic modifications for customization, and maintainability at scale offered huge challenges – but those are the most rewarding to solve.</p>

  <h2 class="content-header">The Approach</h2>
  <span><strong>Focusing on Clear not Cute</strong></span>
  <p>Our reporting product’s mission was accessibility of raw data and actionable insight through effective information design. This required understanding the workflows and objectives of your audience and the discipline to put data clarity first. The latter becomes increasingly disheartening the more you analyze attempts to productize quantitative representation of data.</p>
  <p>We drew inspiration from information design and data visualization thought leaders like Edward Tufte, Stephen Few, and scientific publications focused on effective communication of data. By focusing on data clarity, we became experts in the usages of appropriate chart types, reducing ink, splitting up complex thoughts into concise insights, and text alignment.</p>
  <p>In total we created over 40 reports analyzing different channels and use cases. All of the current reports can be viewed at the <a href="https://simplymeasured.com/sample-reports/" target="_blank">Report Sample Page</a>. Exampled below are the Cross-Channel Label Performance and Facebook Global Pages reports.</p>

          <p>Simply Measured are the best single-source solution for web and social analytics out there. The fact that they are able to consolidate metrics into a single, easy-to-use reporting dashboard make my life a lot easier. The aesthetics behind the reporting also make things easier to digest when sharing metrics across the organization.</p>
