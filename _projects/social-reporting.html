<div class="{{ site.project-wrapper }}">
  <p>I joined Simply Measured in 2012 as the 19th employee because the team was doing impossible things within the constrained platform of Microsoft Excel and paving the way for the new industry of Social Measurement. Our passion was making social media data accessible to all organizational levels and empower digital marketers to do their best work simply.</p>
  <div class="spacer"></div>
  <h2 class="content-header">My Roles</h2>
  <p>I held a wide range of responsibilities as one of two Product Designers of our reporting product and was involved in technical projects with our engineering teams to deliver new functionality to our users.</p>
  <p class="body-header">UI &amp; UX Designer</p>
  <p>I was the sole Report UI designer who created the visual layers of the entire portfolio of over 50 reports. I worked with our Product Marketing and Analyst teams to craft the stories of each report from ideation and implemented the visual layer entirely in Excel using [way too many] AutoShapes. My mission was to delight the user with beautiful visualizations and make them think “wow, this can’t be Excel.”</p>
  <p class="body-header">Technical Product Designer</p>
  <p>I worked on an array of engineering projects to bring new functionality to our reporting platform and created numerous automation solutions through custom Excel plugins using C# and VBA.</p>

    <h2 class="content-header">The Problem</h2>
    <p>Designing a delightful product experience within a familiar but stigmatic platform was an exciting problem solving opportunity.</p>
    <p class="body-header">Educating an Industry</p>
    <p>Without a reliable ROI KPI to hook into, major brands had no idea how to measure their social campaigns. It was up to us to educate the industry by transforming data into actionable and insightful information.</p>
    <p class="body-header">The Nuances of Social Data</p>
    <p>Telling a concise and actionable story about a brand’s social activity across different social networks is a balancing act of available data and creating industry standards. Our rapid go-to-market pace meant we were often designing reports before a network’s own API and story was complete.</p>
    <p class="body-header">Effective Information Design</p>
    <p>Effective Information Design simplifies the essence of data into a story that provides insights and enables exploration and discovery. We were pioneering the form to answers of the many social measurement use cases and business objectives through static reports delivered as Excel files rendering on the web.</p>
    <p class="body-header">Reinventing a Platform</p>
    <p>Limitations in design capabilities, systemic modifications for customization, and maintainability at scale offered huge challenges – but those are the most rewarding to solve.</p>

<div class="{{ site.project-wrapper }}">
  <h2 class="content-header">The Approach</h2>
  <p class="body-header">Focusing on Clear not Cute</p>
  <p>Our reporting product’s mission was accessibility of raw data and actionable insight through effective information design. This required understanding the workflows and objectives of your audience and the discipline to put data clarity first. The latter becomes increasingly disheartening the more you analyze attempts to productize quantitative representation of data.</p>
  <p>We drew inspiration from information design and data visualization thought leaders like Edward Tufte, Stephen Few, and scientific publications focused on effective communication of data. By focusing on data clarity, we became experts in the usages of appropriate chart types, reducing ink, splitting up complex thoughts into concise insights, and text alignment.</p>
  <p>In total we created over 40 reports analyzing different channels and use cases. All of the current reports can be viewed at the <a href="https://simplymeasured.com/sample-reports/" target="_blank">Report Sample Page</a>. Exampled below are the Cross-Channel Label Performance and Facebook Global Pages reports.</p>

      <p class="body-header">One Voice, One Product</p>
      <p>Designing reports bound by the constraints of Excel’s SmartShape objects required a lot of creativity. Much of my time was spent at 800% zoom, placing objects around the page. We knew a scalable report development system would be needed to scale and maintain our product.</p>
      <p>We set out to design a narrative structure to effectively communicate quantitative stories of data organized around business objectives, the context to provide insight, and a subset of information for exploration and discovery.</p>
      <p>Best practices and restrictions on the components available eased report consumption by our users and building from this scaffolding and component library decreased development of the report visual layer from a month to a few days.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-6 col-med-7">
      {% include project-img-embed.html

<div class="{{ site.project-wrapper }}">
  <p class="body-header">Benefiting from Standards</p>
  <p>Standardizing components enabled visual complexity that was previously unmanageable. We used z-height to help express the hierarchy of report information with our tiered background shapes. The platform that rendered our reports on the web did not support shadows, so I built them by hand.</p>
  <div class="grid-row">
    <div class="col-sm-12 col-med-6">
      {% include project-img-embed.html
          type = "inline"

          img-src = "/standards_1.png"

      %}
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Designs in Photoshop were replicated using fully opaque rectangles with varying sizes and border radii, masked on top of each other to reveal one new pixel of the shadow at a time. Breaking these shapes up into scalable pieces enabled rapid development of an extremely complex object.</p>

<div class="full-width full-width--text-zebra">
  <div class="{{ site.project-wrapper }}">
    <h2 class="content-header">Extending The Platform</h2>
    <p>We overcame many front-end limitations though an array of hacks within Excel but some features required doing more than the application was ever designed for.</p>

        <p class="body-header">Customization &amp; Theming</p>
        <p>Report customization was a top requested customer feature for years. Excel’s built in theming functionality allowed the user to change only 12 colors in the document fell short of handling a UI built out of hundreds of shapes on a single sheet.</p>
        <p>We develop a system for theming our reports by using JSON theming hashes that mapped shape names with their resulting color. I lead the proof of concept phase of the project, designed two themed versions of each report structurally identical report , and maintained over 24,000 lines of the JSON theming library. This enabled customers to choose from a dark or light base theme and customize their series colors to match brand guidelines.</p>

        <p class="body-header">Dynamic External Content</p>
        <p>Users love seeing their rich media in reports but Excel’s security implications restricted loading external content without allowing elevated access. We created a workaround by modifying the XML of each image with automation software I wrote that enabled the display of account profile pictures, post images and dynamic SVGs into our static reports. This enabled our customers to quickly share their top content and performance for presentations.</p>

  <div class="{{ site.project-wrapper }}">
    <p class="body-header">Powerpoint Exporting</p>
    <p>Our users loved the portability of raw data in Excel data sheets, but communicating the visual layer often meant placing screenshots in Powerpoint. We made this process easier enabling customers to export fully modular and data inclusive object straight into Powerpoint. I paired on the proof-of-concept and managed the logical structure within the excel file to export groups of visuals into slides.</p>
    <p class="body-header">Excel Workflow Automation</p>
    <p>I created a collection of workflow automation utilities within an Excel plugin using VBA and XAML that was used by over 12 team members in our report development and marketing teams. This provided the automation and maintainability required to implement complex designs within Excel. Automating Analyst workflows resulted in a time savings averaging 4+ hours a week.</p>
    <p class="body-header">Version Control for Excel Development</p>
    <p>Maintaining a collection of individual excel files among team members became extremely difficult to scale as a .xlsx file is just a binary zip that you are unable to diff. I spent a year as a UI Engineer on our platform team building an internal Microsoft VSTO distributed version control system with C# and XAML to empower our team to more effectively deliver reliable products. It enabled concurrent workflows for 12 team members of product managers and report developers.</p>

  <p>I delivered cross-functional value across a wide strategic, operational and technical spectrum of the product design and development process. Holding responsibilities as a UX, UI, Visual designer, UI engineer and project lead provided the understanding of how software projects are actually built in the real world. This created my focus and expertise in communicating complex ideas through effective information design.</p>
