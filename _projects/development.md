  title: Development
  sub-title: An effective Product Designer empathizes with and bridges the gap between functional groups during the product development cycle. Understanding how software is effectively built shapes how a designer should design. These development projects were personal explorations to gain a better technical understanding of product development. They enable a proficiency to collaborate and implement designs while protecting the core values of the design.

  body: I designed and coded this portfolio completely from scratch using an empty Jekyll template. A font scale of 1.33 and strong three color palette was created and I was off to development. The portfolio went through a few versions before being releasing as half way through I completely changed the structure of the portfolio from a verbose case-study approach to more of a gallery of my work. This site was first released in January 2018.
