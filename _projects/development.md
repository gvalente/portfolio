  sub-title: An effective Product Designer empathises with and bridges the gap between functional groups during the product development cycle. Understanding how software is effectively built shapes how a designer should design. These development projects were personal explorations to gain a better technical understanding of product development. They enable a proficiency to collaborate and implement designs while protecting the core values of the design.
