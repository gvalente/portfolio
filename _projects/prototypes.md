  title: Prototypes
  sub-title: The ultimate responsibility of a design is to communicate a productâ€™s vision to stakeholders at different levels of the product development process. This communication often manifests visually and understanding the level of fidelity and context required at each stage of the project is important. Low fidelity prototypes can help gain consensus on product direction, validate early features during customer research, and catch early warning flags from those implementing it. High Fidelity prototypes inform all teams of what is actually being built, how it feels, and what edge cases might arise.
