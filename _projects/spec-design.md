  title: Spec Design
  sub-title: This is a product design exercise I did in late 2017. The scenario was to extend the product of a healthcare company that specializes in tracking hard metrics from patient blood tests for overall health and offer personal coaching to achieve wellness goals. The prompt was to develop a product focused on tracking a user’s ‘softer’ metrics like mood, stress level and energy and creating a dashboard that provides the user and a coach with insight. This project was completed in about a day and a half.

  body: The first and most important phase of my design process is to fully understand the prompt by asking a ton of questions. After designing many products in a corporate environment that did not have proper definition, I now enjoy having this phase take up the majority of my time. Typically working with a group to define and dissect a business problem and scenario is my favorite part because there are no constraints, but because I was by myself I answered my own questions to set assumptions.

  body: Once a direction was identified I started storyboarding the self-reporting user flow. With the capture method outlined, I began investigating what types of measurement and analysis I could do with the data to deliver actionable insight for users and coaches. Next I continued sketching to see how these analysis possibilities could form into a cohesive dashboard.

  body: I next moved onto higher fidelity mockups of the self-reporting and dashboard designs.

  body: The dashboard design used the website chrome, color palette and fonts from the company that this hypothetical product was extending.

  body: The final step was to take all interactions on the page and create unique artboards and connect them all with InVision to create an interactive prototype.

  body: All in all this was an excellent design exercise that showcased many of the stages of design a product. There are many things I would iterate, redesign, and add context to but I was bound by the day and a half timebox.
