  <p>Adjusting the color and contrast of an external display is not an impossible task, but plugging your laptop into a projector 10 seconds before showing your work to executives and seeing a washed out mess will at times make you want to jump out a window.</p>
  <p>Projector Corrector is a Sketch plugin that attempts to quickly improve your display by overlaying your artboards to correct brightness and contrast. Toggle an overlay across all pages and fine tune by incrementing the opacity.</p>
  <p>I developed this plugin in July 2016 with JavaScript and open sourced it on github.</p>
